MAIA OVERVIEW:

The Map
MAIA's map consists of a 2D space that is broken into cells. Each cell represents a 1x1 space.
All objects that are placed on the map occupy a single cell. However, within each cell, space
is continuous. In other words, an object can move within the cell it currently occupies. When
it moves out of the current cell, the map updates the cell in which it is located. The within
cell x,y coordinates are in [0,1).

MAIA uses a hybrid map in order to simplify both movement and collision detection. Within-cell
coordinates allow for an object to move sub-cell distances and to move in non-cardinal directions
without having to fudge things so that diagonal movement is costlier. For example, if an object
has an engine with speed 1, it could never move the 1.4 diagonal distance. Cells are used to
simplify collision. If a projectile or explosion impacts a specific cell, the object in that cell
is also impacted regardless of its location within the cell.

Collisions between moving objects are handled when an object tries to move into an occupied cell.
The simulation prevents the movement and instead sets the within-cell coordinate to just inside
the cell it tried to leave.

The Components
Components are really the heart of the simulation. Each component is updated each tick during which
two primary things happen: command processing and action issuing.

Components receive commands from AI scripts via the simulation. Components evaluate the command for
legitimacy before implementing them. Some commands simply change the state of the component. Some
cause the direct issuing of actions.

Actions are returned from component updates. They are passed back to the simulation. Actions represent
requests by the component to change the world state. Some actions are issued without AI commands.
If a component was sent to a particular state several ticks previously, that state may still cause
the component to issue commands. Such as an engine with a non-zero speed will continue to issue
MOVE commands until the speed is set to zero.

The Objects
Objects are mostly just containers for components. They are the glue between simulation, AI and
components. They carry data that involves all the components, such as x,y locations.

Configuration
MAIA is configurable through JSON files. You can create new maps, objects, and components.
They are also used to set up teams.

components.json
maps.json
objects.json

comprise the main library files by which you build scenarios.
