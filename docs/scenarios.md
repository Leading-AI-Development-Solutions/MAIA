# SCENARIOS

This file describes the example scenarios (maps, teams, AIs) included in MAIA.

### Simple Mazerunner - WIP
**MAP** Map 1
**AI** TeamBeta
**DESC** Currently the agent will move around the perimeter of the 10x10 map. There is a single item in the NE corner of the map. When the agent touches it, a victory is singled. However, the agent will continue to move in a circle around the map. Eventually, this will become the basic maze navigation example.
